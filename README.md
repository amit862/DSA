# Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in Python. The implementations are provided for educational purposes, to help individuals learn and understand fundamental concepts in computer science and programming..

## Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Basic array operations and algorithms.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementation of singly linked lists and doubly linked lists along with relevant operations.
- **Stacks**: Implementation of stack data structure and related algorithms.
- **Queues**: Implementation of queue data structure and related algorithms.
- **Trees**: Implementation of binary trees, binary search trees, and relevant operations.
- **Graphs**: Implementation of graph data structure and algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).
- **Hash Tables**: Implementation of hash table data structure and relevant operations.

## Algorithms

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, and quick sort.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementation of linear search, binary search, and relevant variations.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementation of algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, Kruskal's algorithm, and Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning trees.
- **String Algorithms**: Implementation of string manipulation algorithms like pattern matching and substring searching.

## How to Use

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in a separate Python file within their respective directories. To use any implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/amit862/DSA.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the implementation you wish to use.
3. Open the Python file in your preferred IDE or text editor.
4. Use the provided functions and classes as needed in your own Python projects.
